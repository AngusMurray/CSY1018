Developing this website has taken roughly around 40hours + approximately which has been spread out over the course of about a week.

I did not collaborate with anyone else in order build my website, I did however use guides from http://www.w3schools.com/ as they have many useful tutorials for html5 and especially CSS3. Other than careful planning and many hours of reading through tutorials I made everything my self.

In terms of the website itself, all of it works, but some of it not as it should do. The main issue is using flex tags to make the website responsive and viewable of all screen sizes. After having tested it on several devices, PC, laptop, tablet and smart-phone, the smaller the screen size the more the layout gets worse i.e everything feels cramped on phones, images are usually stretched in some way or don't change at all.
I think this could be improved through better implementation of flex and responsive design. Another aspect that has room for improvement, is the interactivity of the website, and keeping users entertained for long enough so that they read everything on the site, so better use of icons, and images.

I think that the things that did work properly were the navigation bar, general site layout, especially the index.html page which I am very happy with and the site footer. All may seem fairly basic, but I am still happy with the way they all turned out.
