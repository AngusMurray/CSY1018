                My passion for games development, like most others, comes from playing way too many video games as a child. <br />I first learned about the developemnt proccess by watching developer videos from 'Naughty Dog'.
                <br />
                <br />
                I was immediately enthralled by the process of developing and design games, and since<br /> I have never been an amazing artist I saw a chance do achieve this through programming and problem solving.
                <br />
                <br />
                My dream in games development is to, hopefully, one day design and create my own games and create the sorts<br />
                of unique experiences only found in gaming. Outside of computers and video games I am usually furthering my martial arts training<br />
                which i have been doing for 10 years, I obtained the rank of Black Belt more than a year ago and aim to train even harder and longer. <br />
                I adore this and computers equally as much hope that I can do both for many years to come.
